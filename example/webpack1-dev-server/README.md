# `npm-install-webpack-plugin` Example

> This example shows how it's possible to start with a minimal project setup
> and rapidly develop by auto-installing both Javascript & CSS dependencies
> without ever leaving the editor.

## Usage

It's recommended to install the same version of Node this is tested against:

```shell
$ nvm install
$ nvm use
```

Clone the `npm-install-webpack-plugin` repo and change directory to the example folder.

Install dependencies required to start working:

```shell
$ npm install
```

Start the server that (that doesn't do anything yet):

```shell
$ npm start
```

Finally, open <http://localhost:3000>, make changes to `server.js`
and watch dependencies get installed as you go!
